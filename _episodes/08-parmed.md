## Production runs

Finally, we are moving forward to the production runs, which are usually performed in an HPC environment. Therefore we won't use these workstations to run the simulations, but we will go over the files needed to run these simulations and will use a simulation we've run for you. 

The `mdin` of the production runs is very similar to the `equil_classical.mdin` but no restraints are applied this time. We will perform 5 runs of 10ns.

We execute the simulations using `pmemd.MPI` which uses similar options as `sander`. These commands may change slightly depending on the system you use to run the simulations. 

~~~
mpirun -np 48 $AMBERHOME/bin/pmemd.MPI -O -i mdin -p system.parm7 -c system.md0.rst7 -x system.md1.nc -r system.md1.rst7 -e system.md1.ene -o system.md1.out -ref system.md0.rst7 -inf system.md1.info
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The resulting files are the same than before, `sander` produces several output files:
- `system.md1.out`: Log file with thermodynamic data of the system stored during the run.
- `system.md1.rst7`: coordinates and velocities to restart the simulation.
- `system.md1.nc`: trajectory in netcdf format of the simulation.
- `system.md1.info`: Information on the performance of the simulation.

## Usual points to take into account when running MD simulations

#### Replicates

#### Length of the simulation

#### NVT or NPT ensembles
